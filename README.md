# Snake-Mouse
This is the first game we make after 3 weeks of Java in the bootcamp
It is a 2 Player game

This game was starting to be created on 24/5/2017
By the end of tuesday 30/5/2017 we had a mess of a code and no one could understand it so that night we started again.
We had only the nights to keep making the game because during the day we still had lectures and challenges to complete so we only had the nights to keep going
Friday 2/6/2017 we finished the game and is now playable.
Snake has is a surprise
